# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Regula is a tool designed to scan IaC templates like Terraform and CloudFormation for security and compliance violations. 
It can detect risky policies, such as overly permissive IAM roles or resource misconfigurations. 

### Example vulnerability

 An IAM role with an admin policy attached to non-essential resources, granting unnecessary privileges.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Trivy is a comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts like AMIs, detecting known vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies. 
It integrates well into CI/CD pipelines for early detection.

### Example vulnerability

An outdated OpenSSL package with known vulnerabilities, which could lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or other exploits.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config monitors and evaluates AWS resource configurations for compliance against best practices and custom rules. 
It helps identify misconfigured resources that might expose the environment to security risks.

### Example vulnerability

A security group allowing unrestricted inbound access (0.0.0.0/0) on sensitive ports, such as SSH or RDP, which could expose the system to unauthorized access attempts.
